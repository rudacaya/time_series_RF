# Yahoo Stock Market time series prediction

- Is it possible to predict stock prices?
- Do we find any trend with exploration and visualization?
- What is the most important feature to predict stock prices?

An exploratory data analysis prediction and a time series predictive model are implemented in this project trying to answer these questions. The prediction model is implemented as a random forest regressor, wich leads to a 99.5% of R^2. The feature importance is performed to find out a high dependency on the most recent values and some trends and analysis is found in a simple data exploration.
